# Blog
Project in Ruby on Rails, where I practice my programming skills. I create a blog where I can post articles. 
I also added the possibility to create an account here. Additionally I write tests and secure the data entered. 
I intend to develop the application and correct my mistakes

# 
To run the application fully, type in the console:
1. mysql -u admin -p
2. password
3. CREATE DATABASE blog_development;
4. CREATE DATABASE blog_test;
5. exit
6. In project - rake db: migrate
